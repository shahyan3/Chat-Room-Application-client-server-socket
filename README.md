CHAT ROOM APP [C PROGRAM]

You have been commissioned to develop a client/server system for an online multi-client
message server. The purpose of this service is to manage a queue of text messages to be
delivered to connected/subscribed connections. All connected clients can add a message and
each message is associated with a channel ID.

Clients are subscribed to multiple channels and
when any of the subscribed channels has a new message, the clients can fetch and see it.
The client and server will be implemented in the C programming language using BSD sockets
on the Linux operating system. This is the same environment used during the weekly practicals.
The programs (clients and server) are to run in a terminal reading input from the keyboard and
writing output to the screen.
